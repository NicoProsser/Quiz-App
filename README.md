# Quiz-App

As the name says it will be a quiz app with questions in random order and at the end I can see a summary of the questions I got right/wrong.

## What did I learn?
```
* Explore & Use More Widgets
* Render Conditional & List Content
* Build More Complex User Interfaces
* Working with DataModels (e.g. the quiz_questions.dart) [Blueprints]
```

## What does it look like
